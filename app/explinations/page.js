        <p>
          <strong>18 U.S. Code ยง 249</strong> is a critical federal statute that 
          addresses hate crimes, imposing punishments for crimes motivated by 
          prejudice against race, color, religion, national origin, gender, 
          sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. 
        </p>
  
        <h2>Why This Law Is Important</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It provides an additional tool for federal prosecution when states 
            cannot or will not pursue hate crime charges.
          </li>
          <li>
            It clarifies the protected classes and circumstances under which 
            these crimes can be prosecuted at the federal level.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Prosecutors use Section 249 to ensure justice when local authorities 
          either do not have strong hate crime statutes or their applications 
          are insufficient to address the particular wrongdoing.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Key Points to Understand</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Interstate Nexus</strong>: For many subsections, the crime must 
            involve interstate commerce or travel. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Penalties</strong>: Offenses resulting in death or 
            involving kidnapping can lead to life sentences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protected Classes</strong>: Race, color, religion, national 
            origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
          </li>
        </ol>

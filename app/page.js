            Pub. L. 111–84, div. E, §4710, Oct. 28, 2009, 123 Stat. 2841, provided that:
            "For purposes of construing this division [see Severability note above] and the amendments made by this
            division the following shall apply:
          </p>
  
          <p>
            "(1) In general.—Nothing in this division shall be construed to allow a court, in any criminal trial
            for an offense described under this division or an amendment made by this division, in the absence of
            a stipulation by the parties, to admit evidence of speech, beliefs, association, group membership, or
            expressive conduct unless that evidence is relevant and admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
            Nothing in this division is intended to affect the existing rules of evidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(2) Violent acts.—This division applies to violent acts motivated by actual or perceived race, color,
            religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of a victim.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(3) Construction and application.—Nothing in this division, or an amendment made by this division,
            shall be construed or applied in a manner that infringes any rights under the first amendment to the
            Constitution of the United States. Nor shall anything in this division, or an amendment made by this
            division, be construed or applied in a manner that substantially burdens a person's exercise of
            religion (regardless of whether compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief), speech,
            expression, or association, unless the Government demonstrates that application of the burden to
            the person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means
            of furthering that compelling governmental interest, if such exercise of religion, speech, expression,
            or association was not intended to—
          </p>
          <p>
            "(A) plan or prepare for an act of physical violence; or<br />
            "(B) incite an imminent act of physical violence against another.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(4) Free expression.—Nothing in this division shall be construed to allow prosecution based solely
            upon an individual's expression of racial, religious, political, or other beliefs or solely upon an
            individual's membership in a group advocating or espousing such beliefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(5) First amendment.—Nothing in this division, or an amendment made by this division, shall be construed
            to diminish any rights under the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(6) Constitutional protections.—Nothing in this division shall be construed to prohibit any
            constitutionally protected speech, expressive conduct or activities (regardless of whether compelled
            by, or central to, a system of religious belief), including the exercise of religion protected by
            the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and peaceful picketing or demonstration.
            The Constitution of the United States does not protect speech, conduct or activities consisting of
            planning for, conspiring to commit, or committing an act of violence."

            <strong>Findings</strong><br />
            Pub. L. 111–84, div. E, §4702, Oct. 28, 2009, 123 Stat. 2835, provided that: "Congress makes the following
            findings:
          </p>
          <p>
            "(1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin,
            gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim poses a serious national problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of communities and is deeply divisive.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(3) State and local authorities are now and will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the
            overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States, including violent crimes motivated by
            bias. These authorities can carry out their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal
            assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the
            actual victim and the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages the community sharing
            the traits that caused the victim to be selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce in many ways, including the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            "(A) The movement of members of targeted groups is impeded, and members of such groups are forced to
            move across State lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining
            employment, or participating in other commercial activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to facilitate the
            commission of such violence.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(E) Such violence is committed using articles that have traveled in interstate commerce.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude were defined by the race,
            color, and ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary servitude were enforced, both
            prior to and after the adoption of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, through
            widespread public and private violence directed at persons because of their race, color, or ancestry,
            or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially motivated violence is an
            important means of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery
            and involuntary servitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            "(8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States
            were adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious and national origin groups were and
            are perceived to be..."

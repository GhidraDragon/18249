        <h2>Federal vs. State Prosecution</h2>
        <p>
          Hate crimes can be prosecuted at either the state or federal level depending
          on the circumstances. The <strong>Attorney General</strong> must certify
          certain cases before a federal prosecution can proceed. This ensures that
          federal resources are used where they are most needed and that federal
          jurisdiction is appropriate.
